
The program will start when we run "Main.java".

1. In Main.java we have created three different kinds of cards: a Bronze Card, a Silver Card and a Gold Card. We test them with some
sample data. To perform a transaction and print the data of that transaction on the console, we have created a method called 'printData' 
in the 'PayDesk' class, where we pass it two arguments - the price of the item and the card.

2. We have created a class named 'Card', which has three fields and a constructor that sets their values and sets the inital 
discount rate to a zero. In this class there is also a method called 'getDiscountRate', which returns the discount rate stored on the card.
We also have an abstract method called 'setDiscountRate',which we need in every child class, since the process is different for every card type.

3. The subclasses 'BronzeCard', 'SilverCard' and 'GoldCard' contain the parent constructor and a 'setDiscountRate' method, the logic
of which depends on the type of card.

4. The 'PayDesk' class is responsible for processing a transaction and printing its details.
It contains only one method 'printData', which is a static method, meaning the class does 
not have to be instantiated for this method to be used. The method prints four pieces of information while also formatting the result.
